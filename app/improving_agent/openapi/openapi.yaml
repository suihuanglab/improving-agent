        A Query object consists of a required Message object with optional additional
        properties. Additional properties are intended to convey implementation-specific
        or query-independent parameters. For example, an additional property specifying
        a log level could allow a user to override the default log level in order
        to receive more fine-grained log information when debugging an issue.
